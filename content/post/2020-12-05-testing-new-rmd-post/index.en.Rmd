# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:ghex) for example:

```{r ghex, fig.cap = 'A geom_hex() plot.'}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, fill = color)) +
  geom_hex()
```
